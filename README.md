Hello, Odin!

I figured that it wouldn't hurt to add a few more lines of
text to this file as a means of reinforcing my Git and command
line skills...

Also,I noticed there's a cool chart that represent, a sort of
colourful, fun way, the number of commits you have made and 
I would really like to see that filled out!

Take care, world...
